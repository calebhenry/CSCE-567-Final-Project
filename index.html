					This is a a set of visualizations that show information
					about the facilities that observe exoplanets. You can
					interact with these by clicking through the two tabs,
					clicking on parts of the legend, as well as hovering over
					points.There are a few key takeaways here. Firstly, we can
					see that the vast majority of these observations are made
					from space, specifically using the transit method, which
					tracks stars dimming as a planet passes in front of them. We
					also see that the only method used by space telescopes is
					tracking transits, and all other methods are done from the
					ground. This leads us to believe that space telescopes are
					responsible for most observations. The Kepler Space
					Telescope is responsible for a magnitude more planetary
					discoveries than pretty much anything else. We see that K2
					and TESS, two other telescopes, also peak off the axis, but
					nothing near the scale of Kepler. The final thing we see for
					this is that the scopes can see a wide variety of spectral
					types.

				<p>
					This is a a set of visualizations that show information
					about stars, the planets that orbit them, and how we have
					gotten better at finding them over time. You can interact
					with these by clicking through the three tabs, clicking on
					parts of the legend, as well as hovering over points. There
					are a few key takeaways here. Firstly, we have gotten better
					and better at seeing smaller stars and planets over time,
					most likely due to better technology. We also see that the
					combination of one planet and one star is the most common,
					and that a system is likely to have more planets than stars.
					It is also evident that there is a positive correlation
					between the mass of a star and the temperature of the star,
					as well as between the size of a star/planet and the length
					of time it takes to transit (pass in front of the star).

				<h5>Galactic Map</h5>
			</div>
			<p>
				Below is a map of every system in the galaxy that we have
				discovered planets orbiting. By manipulating the sidebar, you
				can view different spectral types, as well as expand the range
				of the map. The orange dot is Earth, and the light blue dots are
				other systems. I highly recommend expanding the map to the
				maximum range to see the overall patterns. You will notice that
				the planets seem to move out from Earth in spokes, and that is
				because we can only see the planets if they are at a particular
				angle in reference to Earth. The particularly long one extends
				along the galactic disk, which is more dense compared to the
				others. When you see galactic x, y, and z, that refers to the
				distance in light years the star is in that direction.
